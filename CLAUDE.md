## Data Models
- **Portfolio**: Cash balance, holdings, total value, initial value, last updated
- **Transaction**: Symbol, type, quantity, price, total amount, timestamp, AI recommendation with confidence and reasoning
- **Holding**: Quantity, average price, current price, total value, profit/loss, profit/loss percent, last updated
- **AI Recommendation**: Action (buy/sell/hold), confidence score (0-100), reasoning text

**Important Note**: All Profit & Loss (P&L) calculations use live market prices updated every 30 seconds for consistent and accurate reporting across all components, including Portfolio Overview and individual holdings views. This ensures displayed P&L reflects current market conditions rather than cached database values.

// After (properly memoized)
const getPortfolioSummary = usePortfolioStore(state => state.getPortfolioSummary);
const portfolioSummary = useMemo(() => {
  return getPortfolioSummary();
}, [getPortfolioSummary]);

// Real-time P&L calculation
const totalPnL = realTimeData ? (realTimeData.totalValue - initialValue) : portfolioSummary.totalProfitLoss;

- **Impact**: Login system now handles complex bcrypt hashes reliably, eliminating authentication failures due to environment variable parsing issues

### 2025-06-26: Portfolio P&L Calculation Discrepancy
- ✅ **Critical P&L Display Fix**: Resolved discrepancy where Portfolio Overview tab showed incorrect P&L values ($60.77) while individual holdings correctly displayed live calculations (should have been $133.86)
- **Root Cause**: Portfolio Overview used cached database values from `portfolioSummary.totalProfitLoss` while individual holdings correctly calculated live P&L using `(livePrice - averagePrice) * quantity`
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added `calculateLiveTotalPL` function in `PortfolioManager.tsx`
  - Modified Portfolio Overview to use live price calculations instead of cached values
  - Updated all P&L displays for consistency:
    - Total Portfolio Value: Now uses live prices
    - Total P&L: Now correctly sums live individual holding P&L
    - P&L Percentage: Now calculated from live total value
    - Invested Percentage: Now uses live portfolio value
